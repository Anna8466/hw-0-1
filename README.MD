# DIFFERENCES BETWEEN GIT PULL AND GIT FETCH

## GIT FETCH

```git fetch``` is the command that tells your local git to retrieve the latest meta-data info from the original (yet doesn't do any file transferring. It's more like just checking to see if there are any changes available).


## GIT PULL

```git pull```is a command that allows you to fetch from and integrate with another repository or local branch.
```git pull``` is actually a Git fetch followed by an additional action -typically a Git merge.
